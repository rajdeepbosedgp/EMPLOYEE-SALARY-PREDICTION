Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
This project aims to build a robust system for predicting employee salaries based on demographic and professional attributes using both machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

Project Overview
In this project, various algorithms were applied to predict the salaries of individuals based on the dataset's features. The process includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, evaluation, and comparison of results from both traditional ML and neural network models.
